## How to Use

The four "widget" files and the one "data.json" are to be copy and pasted as-is into a custom widget in StreamElements.

You'll get a window with 5 different tabs of text you can edit - these are the source code files for the widget.

For HTML, CSS, and JS, copy the corresponding widget file contents into the respective tab. e.g., Copy the contents of widget.html into the HTML tab.

For the FIELDS tab, copy the contents of widget.json.
For the DATA tab, copy the contents of data.json.

Click DONE in the bottom right of this window to close.

## Customization

Along the left side you'll find settings for various XP "weights" - the amount of XP a particular event generates. For example, a new subscriber generates 10 XP.
